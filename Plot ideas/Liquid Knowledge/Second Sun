You see a view from the top floor of a tower, overlooking a beautiful city made of marble and gold.
The few symbols you see seem familiar yet completely unknown.
You can see a different tower in another part of the city which hold a smooth red gemstone several hundred feet across.
You hear a door behind you open and look back to see a small child you feel is your son run up to you and jump in your arms.
Spinning around with him in your arms; his laugh fills you with joy.
While spinning, you see a flash of bright red light move through the sky, becoming bigger.
Before you realize what it is, it has already hit the lower floors of the tower.
You hear a deafening sound as the tower is starting to fall down.
You remember waking between rubble to the sight of a cleric dressed in light yellow robes.
The city is under attack.
After getting up, you and the cleric run through the streets of a city once peaceful till you reach the southern docks, where the cleric creates a boat out of a part of the walkway.
As you go out to sea, you see the entire city is set ablaze, like a second sun on the horizon.
