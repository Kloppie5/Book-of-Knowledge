You remember waking up in a cell, chained to the wall.
A guard enters your cell and begins talking to you.
You don't recognize the language but remember understanding it.
"You are going to be exiled for your crimes, a faith worse than death.
The memory of your existence removed from society;
your daughter growing up thinking you ran away before she was born.
If only you had a way to get out of the city with your wife before sunrise."
While saying that, the guard puts a necklace around your neck with a piece of amber attached to it.
"Your wife and daughter will be waiting at the northern docks.
After the necklace has attuned itself to you, say 'Partanis' and you'll be a free man.
Don't ask me why I'm helping you, just, stay safe and find a place where your daughter can grow up happy."
