On the eve of the unveiling of his magnum opus to the king, the concertmaster, together with a large part of his orchestra, died when the concert hall collapsed and burned down after being struck by lightning in a storm. When the rubble was eventually cleared, a graveyard was erected at that location. People that pass through it at night report occasionally hearing a tune carried by the wind.

If the party enters the graveyard with the remains of the concertmaster's violin, they will instead see the spectral remains of the collapsed concert hall. The concertmaster will view the first person through the doors as the king, here to hear his magnum opus. The party can either kill the entire orchestra, followed by the concertmaster, or survive for the full duration of the song. If the person seen as king expresses distaste in the music, the song with abruptly stop, all but the concertmaster will disappear and the remains of the concert hall will appear to burn with blue flames. If the song finishes, the concertmaster will disappear, leaving behind The Pristine Violin. If instead the concertmaster is killed, he will leave behind The Scorched Violin.
