The kingdom of Albatan was subjected to the fallout of a battle between ancient dragons many generations ago. The hellfire from one of the dragons caused the sand nearby to crystalize into purple crystals that harmonize very well with fire magic. These crystals could be used to empower magic users in their crystal form, or be used to suppress magic when pulverized. Crushed crystals have been incorporated in the cement used in the construction of city foundations and walls. These two properties have been conceiled by the royal family by outlawing the use of magic within the kingdom. The crystals are safe from outsiders, since the deserts are home of enormous worms.

The royal family constructed a network of pipes through the deserts which both provide water to hard to reach places and cause fibrations that keep the worms away. The routes between cities therefore follow the pipes.
A cult that wants to sell these crystals has infiltrated the country and has spread the idea that the royal family has been putting a drug in the water to control the population. The king is going to be executed by the people for this.

The princess of Albatan is a regular at an underground magic battle arena.
