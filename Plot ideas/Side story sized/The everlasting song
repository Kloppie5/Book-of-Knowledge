On the plane of [...] most of the gods have died out when there was noone left to remember them.
The only remaining god lives on in "the song of life and death", a song sung all over the plane.
The original meaning of the words are lost to time, yet everyone knows the song.
It is believed that the song leads those who passed away to the afterlife, and if the song would stop, everyone would be left to roam in limbo for the rest of time.
The song was originally passed around from village to village by travelling bards.
With the construction of Cidra, the unofficial capital of the plane, this custom has stopped.
Cities all over the place still sing the song every day, but Cidra makes sure the song never stops.
Children are brough to the Cidra Citadel as soon as they can stand and walk on their own to learn how to sing the song.
When people on the continent die, their ashes are added to the huge obelisk in the center of Cidra which resonates with the song.
All the citizens view this as an honour, making their essence part of the song.
