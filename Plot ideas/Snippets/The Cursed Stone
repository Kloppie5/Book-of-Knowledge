Dubbed "The Cursed Stone" by locals, a big black obelisk stands tall near the village of [...].
When someone touches the obelisk for the first time, a seemingly random effect happens.
Originally called "The Blessing Stone", it was renamed after someone was found dead near it.
That person had tried to dig out the obelisk and when accidentally touching it with his bare hand, he got a heart attack.

Some say the obelisk gives people what they deserve, some say it houses a demon that will always take more than it gives.

A couple approached the obelisk.
The woman was there hoping for a miracle.
Her eyesight had been fading, but was restored by the obelisk.
The man didn't believe her and touched the obelisk.
He pretended to be in severe pain, just to get a reaction out of her.
As the man was laughing, a small black spot was starting to grow on his arm.
When the man was entirely covered by the spot, he turned to dust.
