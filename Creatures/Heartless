The gateway in the mountains near [...] leads to a plane containing wandering humanoids.
Scorched and often on fire, clad in what appears to be high quality steel armor, they are rumored to be guards.
Their chests don't fully cover their insides and their apparently missing internal organs led to them being dubbed Heartless.
While hostile on sight, they are not deemed a threat because they appear to not want to or are unable to cross the gateway.
