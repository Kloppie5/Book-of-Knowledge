Originally created as "Saviors", soldiers to save a losing country in a war with two neighbouring countries.
Originally created in the image of angels to deal out judgement.
Only 50 were made, but they were enough to kill every living creature on the continent.
The blood has caused all the plants and ponds to turn red over time.
Every few years the continent is visited to check on them.
It is unknown whether they don't age or can procreate, 14 have been confirmed to exist during the last check.
