Assistant Trinkets and Baubles

Childhood friend of Victoria Laurent. 

He got over the death of his father fairly quickly, but Victoria didn't. He tried a lot of things to try to cheer her up, until he stole a mask from the local theater and became her jester. Victoria once told him to never grow up, and as a madly in love jester, he will try to do so; for her.
