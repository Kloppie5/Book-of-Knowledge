She and her friend Raymond Martin were kidnapped by bandits when they were little. The bandits killed both her parents and Raymond's father. She followed the adventurers that saved her to Trinkets and Baubles, where she fell in love with learning. The Collector provided Raymonds mother financial support for raising Victoria. She and Raymond are very close now and occasionally help out in Trinkets and Baubles and sometimes travel the world looking for lost history.
